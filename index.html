        The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education;For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy  of the rules.

         The trophy was originally referred to as the NBA Finals trophy,but was renamed in 1964 after Walter A. Brown, the original owner of the Boston Celtics who was instrumental in merging the BAA and the National Basketball League into the NBA in 1949,The original trophy was awarded to the BAA/NBA champions from 1947 to 1976,The trophy was kept by the winning team for one year and given to the winning team of the following year's finals,unless the previous team won again, much like the NHL's Stanley Cup, which continues that tradition to this day.
